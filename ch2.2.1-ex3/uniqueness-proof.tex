\begin{document}

Assume two given admissible sequences differ. We want to show that the permutations their operations encode differ too.

After a common prefix, there will be a first location where the two sequences differ.
One is an \texttt{X}, causing the car on the top of the stack to be emitted.
The other is an \texttt{S}, causing that same car to be \textit{buried} further down in the stack. The next \texttt{X} in that sequence will not emit the buried car, since it must first emit what's above it on the stack.

Therefore the two sequences cannot emit that car in the same point in the permutation, and the permutations differ.
