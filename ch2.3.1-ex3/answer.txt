The statement is true.

In order to see why, consider the definition of the three orders:

Preorder traversal
    Visit the root
    Traverse the left subtree
    Traverse the right subtree

Inorder traversal
    Traverse the left subtree
    Visit the root
    Traverse the right subtree

Postorder traversal
    Traverse the left subtree
    Traverse the right subtree
    Visit the root

And note the following convenient facts:

- For internal nodes, we can disregard the "visit the root" case
  (since we don't care about the order of internal nodes).

- When we do, in those cases the three algorithms are identical.

- For the terminal nodes, we can disregard the two "traverse the
  left/right subtree" steps (since those will both be Î› anyway).

- When we do, in those cases the three algorithms are again identical.

Taken together: when we suppress visiting all the internal nodes,
the nodes that _are_ visited, the terminal nodes, will be visited in
the same order by the preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals.
