The statement is true. This can be seen by induction on the tree.

For an empty tree, the statement is vacuously true.
For a tree with only one node (which is therefore a leaf node), the statement is trivially true.

For any bigger tree, the three traversals have this in common -- they all visit the left subtree before visiting the right subtree:

Preorder traversal
    (Visit the root)
    Traverse the left subtree
    Traverse the right subtree

Inorder traversal
    Traverse the left subtree
    (Visit the root)
    Traverse the right subtree

Postorder traversal
    Traverse the left subtree
    Traverse the right subtree
    (Visit the root)

If (by the inductive hypothesis) we assume that the statement is true for the subtrees, it also follows for the whole tree.
