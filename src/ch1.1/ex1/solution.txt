The solution is a straightforward extension of the two-variable case.

    t <- a
    a <- b
    b <- c
    c <- d
    d <- t

In words, each variable gets assigned to the next one. At the start, the
extra `t` variable holds the old value of `a` (the first variable),
because this value needs to be saved till the end so it can go into `d`
(the last variable). In this sense, the added `t` (temporary) variable
"ties the knot", letting us both overwrite `a` at the start and assigning
its old value to `d` at the end.

The exercise doesn't ask to solve the case of permuting N variables, but
the above technique easily generalizes. Find all the cycles of length > 1
of the permutation, and for each cycle (x1, x2, ..., xn-1, xn), do this:

    t <- x1
    x1 <- x2
    ...
    xn-1 <- xn
    xn <- t

Cycles of length 1 do not need to be handled, since they correspond to
variables which already have the desired value.
