Induction is a powerful technique for demonstrating properties about
infinitely many items in an algebraic structure, such as the integers.

We prove the property for a _base case_ (like zero), and then for one or more
_inductive cases_ (like the successor relation); this is enough to establish
the property for all the elements in the algebraic structure.
