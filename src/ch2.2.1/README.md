**Stacks** allow insertions and emissions at the same end of the list.
Which means that the elements are emitted in the opposite order they were
inserted.

**Queues**, on the other hand, emit elements in the order they were inserted.
Conceptually, insertions happen at one end and emissions at the other.

**Deques** allow insertions and emissions at either end of the list.
