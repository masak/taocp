Just scanning the first score of common words, I get

    would these words sound great?

Which already kind of solves the problem.

Trying a bit harder, I get

    every great story began under their quiet house.

And

    birds still lived about their place.

And

    short hands write funny parts.

I also wrote a simple kind of madlibs generator, and it
produced (among other sentences) the following:

    words built parts.
    trees began miles.
    words start words.
    major lines place clear trees.
    green trees lived light words.
    round miles added black words.

But when I saw the answer under Knuth's solutions, I
figured that I could easily produce a longer sentence:

    eight happy river toads liked heavy metal music,
    doing dance moves until girls tried their party,
    while women shook their boobs among fresh bread,
    until seven adult poets cried large tears, alone.
