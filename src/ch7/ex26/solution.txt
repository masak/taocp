Just scanning the first score of common words, I get

    would these words sound great?

Which already kind of solves the problem.

Trying a bit harder, I get

    every great story began under their quiet house.

And

    birds still lived about their place.

And

    short hands write funny parts.

I also wrote a simple kind of madlibs generator, and it
produced (among other sentences) the following:

    words built parts.
    trees began miles.
    words start words.
    major lines place clear trees.
    green trees lived light words.
    round miles added black words.
