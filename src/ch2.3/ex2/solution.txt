There are only two possible shapes for a tree of three nodes:

    o       o
    |      / \
    o     o   o
    |
    o

For the first shape, there are 3! = 6 possible assignments of the labels,
but for the second shape, there are only 3!/2 = 3 possible assignments
(because the two children are unordered and indistinguishable). In total
there are 6 + 3 = 9 oriented trees.
